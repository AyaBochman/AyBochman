## Hey, I'm Aya ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with over 5 years of experience. 
My journey began in the realm of design, where I discovered my passion for bringing ideas to life through programming. 

I love building web applications from scratch and experimenting with stuff ðŸ˜„

Since embarking on this path in 2019, I've had the enriching opportunity to contribute to the tech sectors across Israel and Europe. 
Along the way, I've also explored the freelance arena, which is no less challenging ðŸ™ƒ
